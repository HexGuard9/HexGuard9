I am a computer science student interested in cybersecurity, and I take steps every day to pursue a career in this field.

## Objective

Driven by a deep interest in cybersecurity, I investigate both offensive and defensive methodologies and consistently refine my skills via labs, CTFs, and personal projects.

I aim to launch my career in entry-level SOC, system administration, or red-team roles, and I remain enthusiastic about learning and facing new challenges.
